### How it works
![How it works](./assets/howitworks.png)

### Environment Setup
To setup the environment, run `conda env update --file env.cpu.yml`, which will create a conda environment called rheed-viz

Next setup the default local database, responding to the commands as follows (blank means hit enter):

`molarcli install local`

If you get a permissions error on linux, you can change the user group of docker using the following command:
`sudo usermod -G docker your_username; su - your_username`

### Start the RHEED database
`python database-setup/dbsetup.py`

### Launching app
Streamlit frontend uses `requirements.txt`
Run locally with `streamlit run app.py`

### RHEED jpg data
* Pre-processed, dimensionality reduced images are in `./data/` saved as `npz` files. They can be loaded as shown in `Rheed-viz.ipynb`
* Process AVI movies by installing ffmpeg and doing `ffmpeg -i MovieName.avi -vf  fps=<num_fps>  c01_%04d.jpg -hide_banner`
* Raw jpgs: https://figshare.com/s/73b8ab6cb131acbbe9d4
